Hi, I am Haoming Yang, A PhD Student at Duke ECE Department advised by Professor [Vahid Tarokh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vahid_Tarokh). I joined Duke ECE in Jan 2023. 

There are two sides about my research:
* Application of Stochastic Differential Equation in Machine Learning: 
  * **Mckean Vlasov** Stochastic Differential Equations and Interacting Particle system
  * Application of **Brownian Bridges**
* Application of Machine Learning in Biology: 
  * **Semi-interpretable** Machine Learning algorithm to model spiking interaction
  * Cross-Subject **Transfer Learning** application in Moth motor program. 

Prior to joining Duke ECE as a PhD student, I was a master student at Duke Statistical Science. I had the honor to work with Professor [David Dunson](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=KwEOawwAAAAJ&pagesize=80&sortby=pubdate) on modeling Brain Connectome. 

I graduated from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (High Honor) with dual Bachelor Degrees in Physics and Statistis.
