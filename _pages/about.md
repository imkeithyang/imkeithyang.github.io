Hi, I am Haoming Yang, a PhD Student at Duke ECE Department advised by Professor [Vahid Tarokh](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/vahid-tarokh). I joined Duke ECE in Jan 2023. 

There are two sides about my research:
* Application of stochastic differential equation in Machine Learning: 
  * **Mckean Vlasov** Stochastic Differential Equations and Interacting Particle System
  * Application of **Brownian Bridges** with PDE in distributional robust optimization and continual learning
* [Application of Machine Learning in Neuroscience and Biology](https://sites.gatech.edu/flap-muri/): 
  * **Semi-interpretable** machine learning algorithm to model neuron spike timing and interaction.
  * Analyzing **Agile Flight Dynamics** of insects. 
  * Cross-Subject **Transfer Learning** application in Moth motor program. 

Prior to joining Duke ECE as a PhD student, I was a master student at Duke Statistical Science. I had the honor to work with Professor [David Dunson](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=KwEOawwAAAAJ&pagesize=80&sortby=pubdate) on modeling Brain Connectome. 

I graduated from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (Highest Honor) with dual Bachelor Degrees in Physics and Statistics.
